Within this interdisciplinary and international setting the faculty employs more than 1100 employees, including about 400 graduate students and about 2100 students. Together they work on a broad range of technical innovations in the fields of sustainable energy, telecommunications, microelectronics, embedded systems, computer and software engineering, interactive multimedia and applied mathematics.\n","\n"," \n","\n","Research at the Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics (DIAM) centres around the analysis of mathematical models arising in science and engineering. This research is both fundamental and applied in nature, and is often inspired by technical applications. The department plays an active role in translating research results into concrete, practical applications. It maintains intensive contacts with other TU Delft departments, the major technological institutes, and the research laboratories of major companies. Within its own subject field, the department provides teaching for the Applied Mathematics BSc and MSc programmes, and also contributes to the teaching of mathematics courses within other academic programmes at the TU Delft and within national programmes such as “MasterMath”.\n","\n"," \n","\n","The Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics consists of six research groups: Analysis, Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis, Applied Probability, Statistics, and Optimisation.
